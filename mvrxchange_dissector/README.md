Then either restart Wireshark or reload it by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-L`.

## Usage

Apply this protocol by typing `mvrxchange` into the display filter top input
line in Wireshark. Full MVR Messages json is printed into the console, it is
thus useful to run Wireshark from a terminal.

## Modifications

You can modify the dissector by editing the `mvrxchange.lua` file, then reload
it by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-L` in Wireshark.
