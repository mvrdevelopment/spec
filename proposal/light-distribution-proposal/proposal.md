# Support for Spectral Distribution in MVR and GDTF

## Linked Issue


# Problem

We want to add the option to define the light distribution for fixtures inside the beam of the fixture. In simple works, this file define how even the light inside a beam is distributed.

# Proposal


## GDTF

### New Geometry Type Speaker

We will add a new geometry type speaker. This represents one speaker inside the device and will act like the origin of the audio source. By default a audio device with two "real-world" speakers will have one GDTF Geometry speakers, as the properties for visualization and planning will be combined by this two things.
