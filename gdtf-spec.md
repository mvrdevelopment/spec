GDTF Version 1.2 Draft 1

# Introduction

In the lighting and entertainment industry, lighting fixtures
(luminaires and other controllable devices) have become more and more
complex, and the development of these devices happens faster than ever.
New devices are designed with very involved structures; they have
numerous complex color-mixing systems and mode dependencies. To give the
user access to the enormous flexibility of existing devices, a method of
providing accurate fixture type data, and controlling and
pre-visualizing devices quickly and precisely as possible, is needed.
The "General Device Type Format" (GDTF) is that method.

There are many different lighting consoles and software manufacturers on
the market, and all of them use different file formats and methods of
getting the fixture control information into their systems. The
development of new high-end fixtures at an amazing rate creates a lack
of available control data on the side of the console and
pre-visualization software manufacturers. Also, fixture manufacturers
are often approached directly by their clients with requests to support
them with accurate fixture types. As there are so many different
consoles and visualizers on the market, this process requires vast
knowledge of many different systems. Fixture manufacturers would need to
understand how every console or visualizer works, and how to provide the
required data. A format description is needed that not only provides all
of the required control information, but also structures it in a
hierarchical way matching that of the described device.

The lighting designer who would like to use these devices has to deal
with such obstacles. Designers often receive the device control data of
a specific new fixture later than expected. Also, the data may be
incomplete, because it was not created with the latest information from
the fixture manufacturer.

These issues demonstrate that our industry needs a standardized way of
defining the description of intelligent and complex devices. This
document defines such a data format. After the DIN SPEC has been
published, the format will continue to be developed further, but it is
important to make an initial version publicly available. Topics for
which no specifications can be made at this time, but which will soon
become necessary, are therefore already included in this DIN SPEC, but
with a note that no specifications can be made now.

# Scope

This document specifies the "General Device Type Format" (GDTF), a
unified way of listing and describing the hierarchical and logical
structure and controls of any type of controllable device
(e.g. luminaires, fog machines, etc.) in the lighting and entertainment
industry. It will be used as a foundation for the exchange of device
data between lighting consoles, CAD and 3D-pre-visualization
applications. The purpose of an existing GDTF file is to reflect the
real-world physical components of the devices and to provide control
based on this information. It contains and is derived from the 3D
geometry (real world or virtual) of the device. This document is only
applicable for lighting systems and equipment used in the entertainment
industry.

## File Format Definition

To describe the device type, a zip file with the extension
"\*.gdtf" is used. The archive shall contain a description XML file and
resource files. Some of the resource files are located in a folder
structure. There are two folders defined: "./wheels" and "./models". The
folder "./models" has subfolders for a better structural overview:
- ./models/3ds
- ./models/gltf
- ./models/svg

The description.xml file
contains the description of the device type and all DMX modes as well as
all firmware revisions of the device.

The ZIP archive name is specified as follows:
`<ManufacturerName>@<FixtureTypeName>@<OptionalComment>`

Example: `generic@led@comment`

UTF-8 has to be used to encode the XML file. Each XML file internally
consists of XML nodes. Each XML node could have XML attributes and XML
children. Each XML attribute has a value. If a XML attribute is not
specified, the default value of this XML attribute will be used. If the
XML attribute value is specified as a string, the format of the string
will depend on the XML attribute type. All XML attribute types are
specified in [Table 1](#user-content-table-1 ).

</div>

The order of the measurements corresponds to their ascending physical
values.

Additional definition for additive color mixing: It is assumed that the
physical value 0 exists and has zero output.

Additional definition for subtractive color mixing: The flag is removed
with physical value 0 and it does not affect the beam. Physical value
100 is maximally inserted and affects the beam.

Note 1: Some fixtures may vary in color response. These fixtures define
multiple measurement points and corresponding interpolations.

As children the Measurement Collect has an optional list of a
[measurement point](#user-content-measurement-point ).

#### Measurement Point

The measurement point defines the energy of a specific wavelength of a
spectrum. The XML node for measurement point is `<MeasurementPoint>`. The
defined XML attributes of the measurement points are specified in [table 
19](#user-content-table-19 ).

It is recommended, but not required, that measurement points are evenly
spaced. Regions with minimal light energy can be omitted, but the
decisive range of spectrum must be included. Recommended measurement
spacing is 1 nm. Measurement spacing should not exceed 4 nm.

## Model Collect

Each device is divided into smaller parts: body, yoke, head and so on.
These are called geometries. Each geometry has a separate model
description and a physical description. Model collect contains model
descriptions of the fixture parts. The model collect currently does not
have any XML attributes (XML node `<Models>`). As children, Model Collect
has a list of [model](#user-content-model ).

### Model

This section defines the type and dimensions of the model (XML node
`<Model>`). The currently defined XML attributes of the model are
specified in [table 32](#user-content-table-32 ).

<div id="table-32">

#### Table 32. *Model Attributes*

| XML Attribute Name | Value Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Name               | [Name](#user-content-attrtype-name )       | The unique name of the model |

| File               | [Resource](#user-content-attrtype-resource )   | Optional. File name without extension and without subfolder containing description of the model. Use the following as a resource file:<br />- 3DS or GLB to file to provide 3D model.<br />- SVG file to provide the 2D symbol.<br />It is possible to add several files with the same name but different formats. Preferable format for the 3D model is GLTF. The resource files are located in subfolders of a folder called <code>./models</code>. The names of the subfolders correspond to the file format of the resource files (3ds, step, svg). The path for 3ds files would be <code>./models/3ds</code>. For glb files, it would be <code>./models/gltf</code>.</p> Software that is utilizing GDTF files should always be able to read both 3ds and GlTF file formats and should be able to write at least one of these formats. It is preferable that only one type of 3D model file formats is used within one GDTF file. |

</div>

The model currently does not have any children.

All models of a device combined should not exceed a maximum vertices count of 1200 for the default mesh level of detail.

There are three level of details that you can define:

#### Table 33. *Mesh level of detail*

<div id="table-33">

| LOD  | Description  |  Folder 3DS / gltf |
|---|---|---|
| Low  | Optional; This is the mesh for fixtures that are far away from the camera. It should have 30% of the the vertexes from the default mesh vertex count.  | `3ds_low` / `gltf_low`  |
| Default  | This is the default mesh that is used for real time visualization in preprogramming tool. It should have the minimum vertex count possible, while still looking like the fixture in 3D.  | `3ds` / `gltf` |
| High  | Optional; This is high quality mesh targeting non-realtime applications, where the vertex count is not that important. There is no limit for the vertex count. | `3ds_high` / `gltf_high`  |

</div>

Low and High meshes definitions are optional. Place the file with the same name in the defined folder.


The device shall be drawn in a hanging position displaying the front
view. That results in the pan axis is Z aligned, and the tilt axis is X
aligned.

The metric system consists of the Right-handed Cartesian Coordinates
XYZ: X – from left (-X) to right (+X), Y – from the outside of the
monitor (-Y) to the inside of the monitor (+Y), Z – from bottom (-Z) to
top (+Z). 0,0,0 – center base plate. See Figure 2.

![media/Models\_device\_hanging\_1.1.png](media/Models_device_hanging_1.1.png
"media/Models_device_hanging_1.1.png") Figure 2. Device in a hanging
position – front view

The mesh of each fixture part shall be drawn around its own suspension
point. The zero point of a device does not necessarily have to contain
the offset related to the yoke, but it must be centered on its axis of
rotation. The offset is defined by the geometry and has to be related to
its parent geometry and not to the base. 

Note 1: In general, the offsets are mostly negative, because the device is
displayed in a hanging position.

![Device Offsets](media/Models_device_offsets_1.1.png) Figure 3. Offsets of the parts

In Figure 3 the green arrow displays the offset of the yoke related to
the base. The magenta arrow displays the offset of the head related to
the yoke. The offsets are to be defined by the position matrix of the
according geometry ([table 35](#user-content-table-35 ) – [table 55](#user-content-table-55 )). 
It is important that the axis of rotation of
each device part is exactly positioned (see Figure 4).


![media/Models\_device\_rotation.png](media/Models_device_rotation.png) Figure 4. Positions of rotation axis

The dimension XML attributes of model (see [table
32](#user-content-table-32 )) are always used, no matter the scaling and
ratio of the mesh file. The mesh is explicitly scaled to this dimension.
The length defines the dimension of the model on the X axis, the width
on the Y axis and the height on the Z axis.

SVG use viewboxes to align their content. The viewbox is always defined ny the
top left of the bounding box. With the attributes `SVG_VIEW_Offset_XY` you can
define the insertion point in relation to the view box.

SVG can have background filling. This filling should have the color #C8C8C8. By
this color, any software can replace it with another color.

| Type  | Description  | Folder 3DS / gltf |
|---|---|---|
| Top View  | View from top in -Z direction. | `svg` |
| Front View  | View from  fron in Y direction | `svg_front` |
| Side View  | View from  fron in -X direction  | `svg_side` |

SVG images should be drawn in a 1:1 scale to the actual device. Use mm as base unit. Scaling operation from 3D meshes will not be applied to the SVG informations

### Regarding glTF Files

The used glTF files should follow these requirements:

 - Use the `glb` binary format
 - Only use the 2.0 version
 - Do not use extension
 - Do not use animations
 - Only use jpeg or png texture resource
 - all vertex attributes are `GL_FLOAT`

 ### Regarding SVG Files

- Use SVG 1.1 spec
- Don't embed bitmap images.
- Align the viewbox to the top left of the device

## Geometry Collect

The physical description of the device parts is defined in the geometry
collect. Geometry collect can contain a separate geometry or a tree of
geometries. The geometry collect currently does not have any XML
attributes (XML node `<Geometries>`). The currently defined children nodes
of geometry collect are specified in [table 34](#user-content-table-34 ).

The beam has the same children types as the geometry collect (see
[table 34](#user-content-table-34 )).


Use the Geometry Type "Beam" to describe the position of the fixture's
light output (usually the position of the lens) and not the position of
the light source inside the device. The origin of the Geometry Type
"Beam" is the origin of the rendered beam. The origin of the Geometry
Type "Beam" should not be covered by any faces of other geometries in
order to not block the rendered beam.

The `<BeamType>` describes how the Beam will be rendered.

"Wash", "Fresnel", "PC"- A conical beam with soft edges and softened field projection.

"Spot" - A conical beam with hard edges.

"Rectangle" - A pyramid-shaped beam with hard edges.

"None", "Glow" - No beam will be drawn, only the geometry will emit light
itself.

The beam geometry emits its light into negative Z direction (and Y-up).

As children, the Geometry Type Reference has a list of breaks. The
count of the children depends on the number of different breaks in the
DMX channels of the referenced geometry. If the referenced geometry, for
example, has DMX channels with DMX break 2 and 4, the geometry reference
has to have 2 children. The first child with DMX offset for DMX break 2
and the second child for DMX break 4. If one or more of the DMX channels
of the referenced geometry have the special value “Overwrite” as a DMX
break, the DMX break for those channels and the DMX offsets need to be
defined.

#### Break

This XML node specifies the DMX offset for the DMX channel of the
referenced geometry (XML node `<Break>`). The currently defined XML
attributes of the break are specified in [table 49](#user-content-table-49 ).

The `Geometry` should be the place in the tree of geometries where the function
of the DMX Channel (as defined by ChannelFunction) is located either physically
or logically. If the DMX channel doesn't have a location, put it in the top
level geometry of the geometry tree. Attributes follow a trickle down
principle, so they are inherited from top down. 

As children the DMX channel has a list of [logical
channels](#user-content-logical-channel ).

###### Logical Channel

The Fixture Type Attribute is assigned to a LogicalChannel and defines
the function of the LogicalChannel. All logical channels that are
children of the same DMX channel are mutually exclusive. In a DMX mode,
only one logical channel with the same attribute can reference the same
geometry at a time. The name of a Logical Channel cannot be user-defined
and is equal to the linked attribute name. The XML node of the logical
channel is `<LogicalChannel>`. The currently defined XML attributes of the
logical channel are specified in [table 59](#user-content-table-59 ).

## Annex A. (normative) Attribute Definitions

To describe the fixture types attributes are used. Attributes define the
function. (n) and (m) are wildcards for the enumeration of attributes
like Gobo(n) - Gobo1 and Gobo2 or VideoEffect(n)Parameter(m) -
VideoEffect1Parameter1 and VideoEffect1Parameter2. Fixture Type
Attributes without wildcards (n) or (m) are not enumerated. The
enumeration starts with 1. The currently defined Fixture Type Attributes
are specified in [table A1](#user-content-table-a1).

Note 1: The predefined Fixture Type Attributes are the preferred to use Fixture
Type Attribute. At any time user defined attributes can be introduced as well.

## Annex E (normative) Wheel Slot Image Definition

Definition of images used in wheel slots to visualize gobos, animation
wheels or color wheels.

Gobo images shall be in PNG format with an alpha channel. Indexed,
Greyscale and Alpha, 8bit RGB and Alpha, or 16bit RGB and Alpha are
accepted pixel formats.

![Gobo Labeled](media/Gobo_example_labeled.png)

A gobo image is comprised of a transparent Background (1) and the image
itself on top. The Background shall be fully transparent and should be
considered to be the equivalent of a gobo holder. The Image region shall
be fully opaque aside from anti-aliasing, and shall be as large as
possible.

Note 1: This allows a data consumer to determine the precise pixel extents of
the Image and place the provided PNG over an arbitrary GUI background without
additional processing.

The Background region, the equivalent of gobo holder, is defined by full
transparency (Alpha 0). In the Image region, Pure Black (RGB 0,0,0) is
opaque (2), and Pure White (RGB 255,255,255) is transparent (letter A).

Colored gobos (3) shall use an RGB approximation. The RGB approximation
shall be calculated on the basis of Pure White being the CCT of the
fixture light source and the ICC color profile embedded within the PNG.
(See ISO 15076-1:2010) The default shall be sRGB.

## Annex F (normative) SubPhysicalUnit precisions

### Pulse

Some attributes are named "[EFFECT]Pulse" (for example Shutter(n)StrobePulse). They should behave like a triangular function. Here is how they are defined:
- The main PhysicalUnit is a **frequency** which allows to modify the duration of the period T.
- t = 0s corresponds to the activation of the channel function.
- The **TimeOffset** SubPhysicalUnit is the offset of the end of the pulse from 0, the activation of the channel function, as a percentage of the period T.
- The **DutyCycle** SubPhysicalUnit corresponds to the fraction of one period in which the value is not 0.

![Graph of a Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits](media/Pulse.png "Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits")

*Figure 5. Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits*

If there aren't any value given by the user, the TimeOffset and DutyCycle SubPhysicalUnits are defaulted to 100%:

![Graph of a default Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits](media/Pulse\_Default.png "default Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits")

*Figure 6. Default Pulse-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits*

### PulseClose

Some attributes are named "[EFFECT]PulseClose" (for example IrisPulseClose). They should behave like a decreasing ramp. Here is how they are defined:
- The main PhysicalUnit is a **frequency** which allows to modify the duration of the period T.
- t = 0s corresponds to the activation of the channel function.
- The **TimeOffset** SubPhysicalUnit is the offset of the end of the pulse from 0, the activation of the channel function, as a percentage of the period T.
- The **DutyCycle** SubPhysicalUnit corresponds to the fraction of one period in which the value is not 0.

*Figure 7. PulseClose-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits*

If there aren't any value given by the user, the TimeOffset and DutyCycle SubPhysicalUnits are defaulted to 100%:

![Graph of a default PulseClose-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits](media/PulseClose\_Default.png "default PulseClose-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits")

*Figure 8. Default PulseClose-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits*

### PulseOpen

Some attributes are named "[EFFECT]PulseOpen" (for example Frost(n)PulseOpen). They should behave like an increasing ramp. Here is how they are defined:
- The main PhysicalUnit is a **frequency** which allows to modify the duration of the period T.
- t = 0s corresponds to the activation of the channel function.
- The **TimeOffset** SubPhysicalUnit is the offset of the end of the pulse from 0, the activation of the channel function, as a percentage of the period T.
- The **DutyCycle** SubPhysicalUnit corresponds to the fraction of one period in which the value is not 0.

![Graph of a PulseOpen-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits](media/PulseOpen.png "PulseOpen-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits")

*Figure 9. PulseOpen-like attribute and their SubPhysicalUnits*

If there aren't any value given by the user, the TimeOffset and DutyCycle SubPhysicalUnits are defaulted to 100%:
